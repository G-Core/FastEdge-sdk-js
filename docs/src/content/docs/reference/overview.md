We are excited to anounce the release of FastEdge compute! This is the very first iteration and we
expect a lot of new functionality to be released throughout the year.

We hope you enjoy experimenting and using our new product. We love receiving feedback, so please
feel free to reach out!

We have only just begun our journey into providing WebAssembly at the edge, so please be patient.
This Javascript SDK is not yet fully fledged, but it is growing quickly.

As we test and write more functionality we will endeavour to keep adding to this reference guide.

At present there is all the basic javascript functionality provided by
<a href="https://spidermonkey.dev/" target="_blank">SpiderMonkey</a>. This is the engine our
Javascript product is embedded with.

We will continue to add more, so please check back often!
